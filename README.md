# Feed Reader with Jasmine Overview

In this project the students are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where we come in.

## Running this app

&nbsp; To load this application simply download the materials in this repo, then run the `index.html` file in the main directory. This file includes the SpecRunner information from the Jasmine Framework.


## Tests

7 Tests were implemented in this web application 
* Test suite "RSS Feeds"
  *  a test to ensure  that allFeeds object  is defined and that it is not empty. 
  * a test to ensure  that allFeeds object  has a name defined and that the name is not empty. 
  * a test to ensure  that allFeeds object  has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
* Test suite "The menu"
  * a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
  * a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
* Test  suite  "Initial Entries"
  * a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
* Test suite  "New Feed Selection"
  * a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
